[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/dogbiscuiteater/story.svg?token=PHSQ1Dh4ATR3PVpstZdp&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/dogbiscuiteater/story)

### description

story is a terminal command history search utility, inspired by the excellent [hstr](https://github.com/dvorka/hstr).
It provides two main views of a history file, one ordered by time, the other by the frequency of use.
The time-ordered view lists all of the history entries (defaulting to descending order)
The grouped view brings together identical lines and gives a frequency count of each line (again defaulting to 
descending order)

story is written in [go](https://golang.org). 

### installation

Install story by running `go build` from the `cmd` directory.
